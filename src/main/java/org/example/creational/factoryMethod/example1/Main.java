/**
 *      Factory patterns encapsulate the objection creation code.
 *      (separating the logic of object creation from the business logic)
 *
 *      Def -: The Factory Method Pattern "defines" an interface(contract)
 *             for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
 *
 *     They say “decide” not because the pattern
 *     allows subclasses themselves to decide at runtime, but because the creator class is written
 *     without knowledge of the actual products that will be created, which is decided purely by
 *     the choice of the subclass that is used
